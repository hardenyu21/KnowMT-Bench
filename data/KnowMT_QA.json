        "What the cons of a 95% mortgage for UK homebuyers?"
      ],
      "answer": "a. Potentially lower maximum loan amounts Depending on the lender, with a 95% mortgage, you may have a ceiling on how much you can borrow, no matter how good your credit rating is and no matter how high your income. b. Higher interest rate Usually, the larger the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio for the mortgage, the higher the interest rate you’ll pay on the loan. That means 95% mortgages will generally come with a higher interest rate than a 90% mortgage for example. But, you have to decide if you think you’ll be able to save up for a larger deposit quicker than property prices will rise. c. Higher lending charges When you take out a mortgage with a small percentage deposit, you’re borrowing a large percentage of money compared to the property’s price. So, you’ll have a high loan to value (LTV), which means you may have to pay a higher lending charge (HLC). d. There’s a greater risk of negative equity As you’d be starting off with just 5% of the value of your home, if property prices go down you may end up in negative equity. That’s when you owe more on the mortgage than the property’s worth. Of course, as you pay off your mortgage and the percentage of the property that you own increases, there should be less chance of this happening. e. You may find it hard to remortgage Because you’d be starting off with a low percentage of equity in your home, it may take a while for you to get your LTV down low enough to qualify for the usually more competitive rates offered from a remortgage.",

Cash-out Refinancing - This occurs when the value of the asset securing the loan has increased. The borrower takes out a new, larger loan, receives the difference in cash, and often pays a higher interest rate. This allows access to equity without selling the asset. 3. Cash-in Refinancing - This allows the borrower to make a lump-sum payment toward the loan principal to reduce the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio or decrease monthly payments. 4. Consolidation Refinancing - This is used to combine multiple loans or debts into a single loan with a lower average interest rate, making repayment more manageable.",

This decline has profound implications for monetary policy. With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the FOMC has less room to cut the policy interest rate when needed to support the economy. It also means that the federal funds rate is likely to be constrained by the effective lower bound more frequently than in the past. Another important change is that prior to the pandemic we witnessed a record long expansion in which the labor market was very strong and did not trigger a significant rise in inflation. The gains in the labor market were widely shared across society, and thus the revised statement reflects a greater appreciation that the benefits of a strong labor market may be sustained without triggering an unwelcome rise in inflation.",

The revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy reflects the view that this objective can best be met by seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. If inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then over time inflation will average less than 2 percent. Inflation averaging less than 2 percent over time can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which in turn can pull actual inflation lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of lower inflation and inflation expectations. With lower expected inflation, the nominal level of interest rates will be lower too, leaving less room for the FOMC to cut interest rates when needed to support the economy in a downturn. By seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time this will help ensure longer-run inflation expectations do not drift down and remain well anchored at 2 percent. For these reasons, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.",

Examples of a seasonal branch include the operation of a branch during school registration periods on the campus of a college or at a fixed site adjacent to the campus, and the operation of a branch during a state fair on state fairgrounds or at a fixed site adjacent to the fairgrounds. Seasonal branches are not considered temporary branches, and the branch closure notice requirements under section 42 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act apply to the closure of seasonal branches. Section 42 requires a state member bank that proposes to close any branch to provide notice of the proposed closing to the Federal Reserve at least 90 days prior to closing, to mail notice to affected customers informing them of the planned closing at least 90 days prior to closing, and to post a notice at the branch site at least 30 days prior to closing. Seasonal branches, however, are often open for less than 30 consecutive days at a time. In these cases, Board staff has considered the 30-day notice posting requirement to be fulfilled where notice of the planned closure is posted at the seasonal branch for the entire duration that the branch is open, even if the branch is open for less than 30 days. The notice posting requirement may also be fulfilled by posting notice for the full 30 days at the site of the recurring event at any time prior to closure of the seasonal branch, even if the event is not occurring during that 30-day period. The seasonal branch would then be deemed closed once all notice requirements, including the 90-day notice to the Federal Reserve and the 90-day notice to customers, are fulfilled.",

      ],
      "answer": "Whether the amount attributable to the leverage loan is included in the state member bank's public welfare investment amount, which is used to determine compliance with the aggregate public welfare investment limits, depends on the structure and terms of the investment. State member banks may structure public welfare investments through a consolidated subsidiary or an unconsolidated entity. The subsidiary or entity receives the leverage loan and combines it with the equity investment to fund one or more public welfare investments. In an unconsolidated investment structure, only the bank's equity investment is reflected on the bank's balance sheet. Accordingly, the amount of the leverage loan is not an exposure of the bank, either from an economic (because the third-party lender has no recourse to the bank) or accounting perspective. Therefore, in this situation, the bank does not need to include the amount of the investment attributable to the leverage loan in its public welfare investment amount. In a consolidated investment structure, although the third-party lender has no recourse to the bank if the leverage loan is not repaid, the entire investment made by the subsidiary, using the proceeds from both the equity investment and the leverage loan, is reflected as an asset on the bank's balance sheet (and the leverage loan is reflected as a liability). Accordingly, as a general rule, the entire amount of the investment made by the subsidiary is treated as a public welfare investment made by the bank. However, under these circumstances, a state member bank may exclude from its public welfare investment amount the amount attributable to the leverage loan if the investment is eligible for New Markets Tax Credits (NMTCs), 26 U.S.C. § 45D, or Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs), 26 U.S.C. § 42, a majority of the bank's equity return derives from such tax credits, and the bank's equity investment is written down as the tax credits are received. This approach to NMTC and LIHTC investments facilitates the ability of a state member bank to make these types of public welfare investments in a safe and sound manner without unnecessarily constraining the amount of capital that the bank may allocate to such investments within the aggregate public welfare investment limits. State member banks must continue to ensure that public welfare investments made pursuant to section 208.22(b) of Regulation H meet the applicable permissibility criteria, including that such investments do not expose the bank to liability beyond the amount of the investment. 12 CFR 208.22(b)(3). For purposes of determining the appropriate accounting treatment for public welfare investments and related investment structures, including whether an entity must be consolidated, state member banks should refer to the Call Report instructions and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.",

The second structure is similar to the first structure, except that it would involve a third party, either as the initial seller of the commodity to the bank holding company, or as the ultimate purchaser of the commodity from the bank holding company. During the term of a CPFS transaction, the bank holding company would (i) hold title to the underlying commodity, (ii) mark the commodity to market on a daily basis, and (iii) call for additional margin if the market value of the commodity falls below a specific collateral threshold. Under either structure, a variety of conditions must be met to ensure that the CPFS transaction does not expose the bank holding company to risks that would be inconsistent with a financing arrangement. For example, the bank holding company must earn a fixed return on a CPFS transaction, just as it would on an ordinary secured loan, and its risk exposure effectively must be limited to counterparty credit risk. All non-price risks and costs of owning the commodity during the term of the CPFS transaction must be borne by the ultimate purchaser. In all cases, although the bank holding company would take title to the underlying commodity at the inception of a CPFS transaction, it would take title in the form of a warehouse receipt only; that is, the commodity would continue to be stored in a licensed warehouse owned and operated by an entity other than the bank holding company.

The rules governing control and divestiture proceedings, subpart D of Regulation Y as amended by the 2020 amendments (the control rule), do not differentiate between limiting contractual rights based on the circumstances under which the right was created or the nature of the document in which the right resides. The influence that a limiting contractual right provides its holder does not vary based on the circumstances of the right's creation or the document in which the right is incorporated. In particular, the control rule does not create any exception from the definition of a limiting contractual right for covenants in a loan agreement. Importantly, the control rule's presumption of control related to limiting contractual rights does not apply where the first company controls less than 5 percent of any class of voting securities of the second company. As a result, loan covenants generally do not raise control concerns by themselves, but instead raise concerns when held by a first company that also controls 5 percent or more of any class of voting securities of a second company.",

Issuer Shareholders' Equity should be calculated as the sum of Investor Common Equity and Investor Preferred Equity for each person that controls equity instruments of the second company. Such an approach to the definition of Issuer Shareholders' Equity ensures that the numerator and denominator used to determine a first company's total equity ownership of a second company are both calculated in a consistent manner based on U.S. GAAP. Under this approach, a first company that controls less than one-third of each class of equity securities of a second company should always control less than one-third of the total equity of the second company.

Under Regulation Y, a group is \"acting in concert\" when there is knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action toward a common goal of acquiring control of a state member bank or bank holding company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The regulation includes a presumption that investors in a state member bank or bank holding company that are parties to any agreement, contract, understanding, relationship, or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise, regarding the acquisition, voting, or transfer of control of voting securities of a state member bank or bank holding company, other than through a revocable proxy, are a \"group acting in concert.\" In limited circumstances, Board staff would not recommend that the Board find that the parties to a shareholders' agreement are a group acting in concert for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act.

In the event a shareholders' agreement entered into by all or substantially all of the shareholders of a state member bank or bank holding company includes provisions other than those described above, you may consult with Federal Reserve staff as to whether the agreement would result in the parties to the agreement being a \"group acting in concert\" for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act.

      ],
      "answer": "Yes. Regulation Y provides that a person is presumed to be acting in concert with any trust for which the person serves as trustee. The regulation also includes a presumption that persons are a group acting in concert if they are parties to any type of arrangement, regarding the acquisition, voting, or transfer of control of voting securities of a state member bank or bank holding company, other than through a revocable proxy.” The specific powers exercisable by a trustee often include broad authority to acquire assets, vote securities held in trust, and transfer control of trust property. As a result, a person with an unrestricted right to remove and replace the trustee of a trust would indirectly be able to influence the exercise of the trustee's powers. Thus, Board staff views such a party as part of a group acting in concert with both the trust and its trustees. However, if a person has only limited rights to remove and replace the trustee of a trust, staff generally would not view such person as acting in concert with the trust and its trustee for purposes of Regulation Y. You may consult with Federal Reserve staff as to whether a limited right to remove and replace the trustee of a trust would cause a person to be presumed to act in concert with the trust and its trustees for purposes of the Change in Bank Control Act (12 U.S.C. § 1817(j)) and Regulation Y.",

Nevertheless, banks are required to adhere to the \"fit for purpose\" principle when implementing the system i.e. the technical implementation of the security measures and other controls adopted by banks for their electronic banking systems is required to be commensurate with the risks associated with the types and amounts of transactions allowed, the electronic delivery channels adopted and the risk management systems of individual banks. As such, in respect of two-factor authentication, banks are required to select reliable and effective authentication techniques to authenticate the identity and authority of their e-banking customers. In general, banks are required to employ stronger customer authentication for authenticating their customers' transactions with higher risk. Banks need to evaluate carefully other aspects, including whether a particular authentication method is sufficiently mature.

      "answer": "Generally speaking, the earlier a borrower makes loan repayment, the more outstanding interest payments are likely to be saved in Hong Kong. Nevertheless, borrowers should consider the early repayment charges involved before deciding whether to pay off their loans early or not. Borrowers need to be aware that individual banks use different ways to apportion interest and principal in the monthly repayment amounts. Even though the monthly repayment amount is the same throughout the loan tenor, more interest will, in general, be included in earlier repayments, and less on principal. In other words, where a borrower has been making repayments as scheduled for some time, the amount of outstanding interest is likely to be small. If the borrower chooses to pay off the loan early at this point of time, the loss may outweigh the gain as the amount of interest saved may not be enough to cover the relevant charges for early repayment. As a smart bank customer, one should first check with the bank about the total amount involved in early repayment (including outstanding loan balance, early repayment charges and other fees, etc.) and the amount of outstanding interest. He/she should then compare different scenarios and consider carefully before making a decision of repaying early or not.",

      "answer": "Supplemental indentures modifying terms of securities outstanding under previously qualified indentures need not be qualified unless the changes are so significant that they are deemed to involve the offering of a new security and, therefore, the obligor either registers the transaction under the Securities Act or relies upon a Securities Act exemption for which there is no corresponding Trust Indenture Act exemption. If the modifications do not result in the offering of a new security, and the offering is ongoing, the supplemental indenture may be filed as an exhibit to an 8-K if the offering is on S-3 (in the same manner as specified for underwriting agreements), or in an automatically effective, exhibits only post-effective amendment filed pursuant to Rule 462(d). For automatic shelf registration statements, the post-effective amendment would be filed pursuant to Rule 462(e). If the offering has terminated, the amended indenture should be filed as Exhibit 4 to the company's next Exchange Act report.",
